This was supposed to replace Bionic because Bionic is hard to use. It is supposed to be able to host users from the school, so they can express interest in classes and see their classmates. Furthermore, the course in the the bi-co are integrated into one list instead of two separate lists; this will help expedite the process of searching for classes. Additionally, the search feature is very helpful to search for the departments instead of scrolling and searching by first letter.
